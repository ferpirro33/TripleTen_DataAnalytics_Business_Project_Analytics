# Project: TripleTen Data Analytics Business Project

## Business Context
This project simulates a professional engagement within the Analytics Department of Showz, an event ticketing platform. The core challenge was to evaluate historical data to optimize marketing budgets and improve customer acquisition strategies.

## 🎯 Research Objectives
The analysis addresses critical business questions through a data-driven lens:

User Behavior: How do users interact with the platform across different devices?

Conversion Funnels: Identifying the exact touchpoints and time-to-conversion for first-time buyers.

Customer Lifetime Value (LTV): Quantifying the long-term financial contribution of each customer.

Profitability & Payback Period: Determining the exact point when revenue offsets Customer Acquisition Costs (CAC).

## 📊 Datasets Overview
Analysis of multi-source data spanning from January 2017 to December 2018:

Web Server Logs (Visits): Session-level data including Uid, device type, timestamps, and ad source IDs.

Transactional Data (Orders): Comprehensive record of purchases and revenue per user.

Marketing Spend (Expenses): Granular investment data categorized by acquisition source and date.

## 🛠️ Analytical Roadmap
Data Engineering & Preparation: Robust ETL process focusing on data type optimization and quality assurance.

Product Metrics: Calculated DAU, WAU, and MAU, session frequency, and ASL (Average Session Length) to determine retention rates.

Cohort Analysis: Segmented users by acquisition date to track conversion velocity, order volume, and average ticket size over time.

Marketing Performance (Unit Economics): * Calculated CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost) per source.

Modeled LTV (Lifetime Value) to understand long-term health.

Evaluated ROMI (Return on Marketing Investment) to identify the "break-even" point of various ad channels.

Data Visualization: Developed comparative dashboards to visualize performance trends across devices and advertising sources.

## 💡 Business Impact & Recommendations
The project concludes with a strategic roadmap for the marketing team. By identifying high-yield sources and inefficient channels, the analysis provides a data-backed recommendation on where to scale investment to maximize ROI and shorten the CAC payback period.
